# Time Machine Project

This project is a simulation of a timeline that adheres to certain conditions and restrictions related to events of types A, B, and C, as well as the scientists Einstein and Rosen.

## Description

The goal of this project is to create a simulation of a timeline that follows the following rules and conditions:

- Events of types A, B, and C.
- Scientists Einstein and Rosen.
- Restrictions to avoid temporal paradoxes.
- Controlled data sharing between type C events.
- Timeline consistency with a minimum of 3 nodes and a maximum of 22 nodes.

## Features

- Use of classes `Node` and `EventList` to represent events and manage the list.
- Generation of random numbers for data and scientists.
- Verification of whether a number is prime.
- Display information about the event list.
- Compliance with specific restrictions and conditions.

## Development Environment

- This project was developed using Replit as the integrated development environment (IDE).
- [Version 1.0](https://replit.com/join/qwhmpkftdr-nickolas10moren) (Contains the code all in the main.cpp)
- [Version 1.2](https://replit.com/join/nnveveznxn-nickolas10moren) (Contains the code with Nodo.h)
